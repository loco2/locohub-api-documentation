# locohub-api-documentation

This repo aims to store static resources for locohub API documentation. It means you can store for example:
* plantUML diagram sources [documentation](http://plantuml.com/en/)
* images

In order to include those static resources into markdown :
* plantUML : `![image description](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.github.com/loco2/locohub-api-documentation/master/plantUML/[DIAGRAM_FILENAME])`
* image : normal way in markdown
